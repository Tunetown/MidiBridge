# This is a class which can be used on CircuitPy boards, to manage files remotely via MIDI.
# The MidiBridgeWrapper class has the same send/receive methods like the adafruit MIDI handler, 
# so you can just put this in between: Create your adafruit MIDI handler, pass it to this class and
# use this in your application just like the adafruit handler, and the MIDI bridge will be able to
# communicate (as long as your application calls receive() regularily of course).
